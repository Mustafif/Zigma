# Zigma
A Zig Library for Mathematical Numerical Method Techniques

> ðŸ“– [zigma.mustafif.com](https://zigma.mustafif.com)

## Purpose

This library is designed to be used to advance the mathematical capabilities of [MufiZ](https://github.com/Mustafif/MufiZ) and also to be used generally in any Zig project that requires numerical methods. Thus most components of this library is completely written in Zig, and can also have methods to accept raw C pointer types.
